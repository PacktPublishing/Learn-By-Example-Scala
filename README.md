## About the Video Course
These 65 examples will make this cool-new-kid-on-the-block your steady, reliable friend. Let’s parse that. Scala is cool because it’s all the rage for big data applications, and because it manages to be more sophisticated and elegant than Java. That said, Java is a steady, reliable friend - a language you can depend upon, and in which you can express yourself. These 65 examples will help you trust Scala the way you trust Java. Each is self-contained, has its source code attached, and gets across a specific Scala use-case. Each example is simple, but not simplistic.
